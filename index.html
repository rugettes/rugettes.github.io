                        <p>From a very young age, I have been fueled by imagination. Whether it was building great Lego kingdoms in the living room or solving riddles in the dark with Bilbo, my inventiveness has matured with me. I have become a creative problem-solver with the ability to analyze problems from myriad perspectives and find solutions where others cannot.</p>

                        <p>The team I currently work with at 3M emphasizes the importance of new technology by setting aside time to learn relevant skills together. One of our most recent efforts was working with WordPress.org. We downloaded the open source code provided on their website as well as the appropriate programs to turn our laptops into servers, edited themes, and worked on creating our own local WordPress sites. However, since I pay for space on a Blue Host server, I decided to take it one step further and learned how to transfer the in-progress WordPress site from my local computer to the server this website uses. The process was daunting, but rewarding, forcing me to learn about things like SQL tables, encryption, and certificates. Check out the unfinished version of my portfolio as a completely self-hosted WordPress.org site below.</p>

                        <h3>dishformyrv.com</h3>
                        <p>Shortly after graduating college, I worked for a small, privately-owned electronics company in Rochester, MN called Pace International. One of their largest sources of revenue was from selling DISH network programming and satellites for recreational vehicles on a website called dishformyrv.com. While there, I was tasked with completely overhauling the website's most popular page to be responsive and written in HTML5/CSS3. Although the dishformyrv.com website has since been redone, the hand-coded Learn More page can still be found on the web archive, as referenced below.</p>

                        <p>A good portion of my current job involves working with JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, RequireJS, and Backbone to solve problems or create new functionality requested by different businesses. One of the first full modules I was tasked with developing regarded a complicated legal matter only applicable to French Canada. Apparently, they have their own version of the trademark symbol (the marques de commerce or <sup>MC</sup>) that the businesses had been representing in their data with the letters MC in parentheses. However, there seems to be some legal complications with this because it's not technically the correct representation of the trademark, so instead of taking the time to change thousands of product names and hundreds of web pages, it was up to me to write some tricky JavaScript involving regular expressions to analyze any page in the French Canada locale, find all instances of (MC) being rendered, and replace it with its superscript version, sans parentheses. Watch it in action below.</p>
